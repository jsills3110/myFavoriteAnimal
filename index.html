            Wolves are fierce and loyal. They hunt in packs. They protect the environment by controlling the population of herd animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides controlling herd populations, they also direct where large herds can roam. For example, grazing by a river makes animals vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>
            If animals graze by a river, they are susceptible to wolf attacks. So the herds only visit rivers to drink and then they leave.
        </p>
        <p>
            This protects the riverbanks from excessive erosion, and it starts a whole chain of impact, all the way down to the organisms that live in the water.
